springs repeater, willow repeater, union hill repeaterpublic safety facilities threatened include pioneer fire protection district stations, amador-el dorado unit headquarters, and the eldorado national forest-pacific ranger station. many school districts in el dorado county have either evacuated, canceled school or postponed the start of school due to the fire.powerlines and/or electrical distribution:pg&e has numerous assets and critical infrastructure threatened including overhead distributions lines, transmission lines, the el dorado powerhouse hydro-facility, distribution substations, telecommunications towers, fiber optic resources, and associated equipment. these assets provide power to thousands of customers in el dorado and the surrounding counties. the approximate value of assets at risk is $11,300,000.liberty utilities has assets of critical infrastructure threatened including distribution lines, transformers, and a substation. disruption would leave apx 20k customers without water and potable water as their infrastructure provides power for water distribution.volca5000 people without cellular or telephone coverage.nv energy has distribution, transmission, and telecom assets in stateline, kingsbury, roundhill, and carson valley, nevada.  nv energy facilities supply power to the entire south lake tahoe area which includes delivery points to liberty utilities at meyers and stateline substations.  the loss of the #111 and #112 (120kv) transmission lines would result in a regional power outage that would extend from glenbrook, nv to approximately homewood, ca around the south side of lake tahoe.  the outages would impact approximately 50,000 nv energy and liberty utility customers.domestic water systems: the grizzly flats csd has been heavily impacted by the fire including damage to water storage and distribution infrastructure. the district relies on water from surface collection and diversions, both of which are impacted and will result in the loss of water supply to apx 1,200 customers.the el dorado irrigation district (130,000 population) also relies on surface water collection in the area of the fire. they operate a diversion facility and 23-mile conveyance system with wooden flumes (have been damaged) of critical importance for the supply of 1/3 of the district's water supply. replacement cost is estimated at $68 million dollars and over a year to rebuild. smud operates 17 dams; 11 reservoirs; nine powerhouses (688 mw generation capacity) and other essential facilities critical in providing power to the sacramento region. this includes a 69kv transmission line with wood poles, 28 miles of tunnels, penstocks, and canals. the riverton maintenance yard is critical to ensure all equipment is

Continued from 12-hrs section above:Domestic Water Systems: The Grizzly Flats CSD has been heavily impacted by the fire including damage to water storage and distribution infrastructure. The district relies on water from surface collection and diversions, both of which are impacted and will result in the loss of water supply to approximately 1,200 customers.The El Dorado Irrigation District (130,000 population) also relies on surface water collection in the area of the fire. They operate a diversion facility and 23-mile conveyance system with wooden flumes (have been damaged) of critical importance for the supply of 1/3 of the district's water supply. Replacement cost is estimated at $68 million dollars and over a year to rebuild. SMUD operates 17 dams; 11 reservoirs; nine powerhouses (688 MW generation capacity) and other essential facilities critical in providing power to the Sacramento region. This includes a 69kv transmission line with wood poles, 28 miles of tunnels, penstocks, and canals. The Riverton maintenance Yard is critical to ensure all equipment is operational.Communication Grid: The critical fiberoptic line relied on for 911 systems and cell towers from El Dorado County to Lake Tahoe along HWY 50 has been damaged.  Numerous communications sites, including Big Hill, a hub for SMUD, CHP, and several cellular carriers are threatened.  This site also includes the ENF's Big Hill fire watchtower.

Continued from 12-hrs section above:Domestic Water Systems: The Grizzly Flats CSD has been heavily impacted by the fire including damage to water storage and distribution infrastructure. The district relies on water from surface collection and diversions, both of which are impacted and will result in the loss of water supply to approximately 1,200 customers.The El Dorado Irrigation District (130,000 population) also relies on surface water collection in the area of the fire. They operate a diversion facility and 23-mile conveyance system with wooden flumes (have been damaged) of critical importance for the supply of 1/3 of the district's water supply. Replacement cost is estimated at $68 million dollars and over a year to rebuild. SMUD operates 17 dams; 11 reservoirs; nine powerhouses (688 MW generation capacity) and other essential facilities critical in providing power to the Sacramento region. This includes a 69kv transmission line with wood poles, 28 miles of tunnels, penstocks, and canals. The Riverton maintenance Yard is critical to ensure all equipment is operational.Communication Grid: The critical fiberoptic line relied on for 911 systems and cell towers from El Dorado County to Lake Tahoe along HWY 50 has been damaged.  Numerous communications sites, including Big Hill, a hub for SMUD, CHP, and several cellular carriers are threatened.  This site also includes the ENF's Big Hill fire watchtower. Transportation:HWY 50, HWY 88, and HWY 89 all have closures in place. These Trans-Sierra highways are vital to commerce, tourism, incident logistical support and emergency evacuation and the impact of their closure is substantial. There are many additional road closures around the fire area with traffic control points in place.Historical and Significant Cultural Resources:Numerous prehistoric and historic cultural resources are threatened, including historic buildings and archaeological sites.
