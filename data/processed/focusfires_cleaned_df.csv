winds already gusting to near 20 mph near round valley from division oscar crew members. afternoon humidity continued to plummet into the teens across many locations this afternoon thanks to deeper

additional resources are required to hold lines in branch xxx to prevent the fires spread onto the west side of grizzly ridge, east towards milford and south towards davis lake, where a significant threat exists to multiple communities. the walker fire scar is holding well as a natural barrier to the east, but our concern is the main fires progression towards the north where it has become

periods based on forecasted fire weather. today the fire moved approximately three miles to the northeast in alignment with the wind, terrain, and fuel. additional resources are required to hold lines in branch xxx to prevent the fires spread onto the west side of grizzly ridge, east towards milford and south towards lake davis and portola, where a significant threat exists to multiple communities.

embedded in the highway 44 corridor. communications to the populations of lassen and shasta counties are at risk.   critical resource needs are essential over the next several operational periods in

resources and large fire area, task force leaders, heavy equipment bosses, safety officers, line safety officers, are needed for appropriate fire line coverage and span of control. critical heavy equipment needs are essential for the completion of priority suppression repair areas before the onset of a season ending weather event, to include moving timber that has been cut, processed, and

fire stays within its current footprint. due to the high number of fire line resources and large fire area, task force leaders, line safety officers, and safety officers are needed for appropriate fire linecoverage and span of control. critical heavy equipment needs are essential for the completion of priority suppression repair areas before the onset of a season ending weather event. gis specialist is needed to replace resources timing out that are currently working with the reads to ensure the products are made to get suppression repair work completed in a timely manner. the reaf is needed to support the suppression repair process as well.logistical needs are changing as events are beginning to happen at the fairgrounds where west zone icp is located. the facility unit leaders, food unit leader, supply unit leader, receiving and distribution manager, base camp manager, and equipment manager are incredibly important to be able to continuesupporting icp and hat creek spike camp. the ambulances, medical support unit, and other medical personnel, are needed to replace resources that have timed out.continued mop up and patrol of 1,000-hour fuels will require a significant number of resources due to the volume of fuels as well as the steep and rugged terrain. holding actions and point protection of communities and critical infrastructure will require a significant resource presence for the next severaloperational periods as well.|to ensure operational success, have a clear understanding of suppression repairobjectives as written within the suppression repair plan. collaborate and coordinate with reads and tribal representatives to complete suppression repair efforts. ensure safety remains priority while working around suppression repair equipment. eliminate hazards to identified roadways by removing fire damaged trees that may otherwise threaten those rights-of-way and to protect public forest users and private landowners from the possibility of trees falling on roadways. protect surface water/water erosion by stabilizing and water barring fire lines and damaged roadways.ww/xx: suppression repair efforts in and around dp 245, dp 244 are

began clear and chilly, with lows in the upper 20s and 30s across the fire area. while the lack of clouds facilitated a chilly start, it also allowed temperatures to effectively warm, rising into the 60s in most spots. winds were generally light, letting terrain-driven winds prevail.similar weather is expected again sunday, with few clouds allowing both a chilly start and good warming through the day. southwest winds look to be slightly stronger, a subtle sign of bigger changes ahead. overnight sunday, a cold front will sweep across the region. though likely a dry front, a few flakes athigher elevations are still an outside possibility through monday morning. the eastern edge of the fire has the most chance of seeing a quick flurry. winds will swing around to northerly and become strong and gusty in the fronts wake.on monday, expect winds to increase to around 20 mph sustained with gusts to around or above 40 mph. considerably colder air will also surge in, knocking high temperatures down about 20 degrees, and setting us up for a couple nights of low temperatures in the lower 20s and even upper teens. tuesday also looks gusty, but winds should diminish with a gradual warming trend
