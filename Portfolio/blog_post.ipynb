    "Narrative reporting from ICS-209 forms offers invaluable, previously non-synthesized insights into the societal impacts of large wildfires. By analyzing these narratives with advanced natural language processing techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER), we can better understand the intricate connections between fire hazard characteristics, management actions, and their societal effects. The case studies of the Dixie and Caldor fires demonstrate the potential of this approach to inform and improve wildfire management.\n",

    "Moving forward, I plan to enhance the accuracy of named entity recognition by fine-tuning models and creating customized pipelines. Additionally, building metadata to categorize threats by type will further refine our ability to link narrative data with other critical wildfire metrics, paving the way for more informed and effective fire management strategies."
