    "Wildfires have increasingly become a significant concern across the United States. Despite only 2% of wildfires becoming significant incidents, these account for 85% of suppression costs and 95% of total acres burned annually. This project post delves into the societal impacts of large wildfires, drawing insights from ICS-209 data, which provides critical information for wildfire management."

(2023).  I processed the narrative fields to convert text about societal impacts into a suitable format for natural language processing and analyze text to find links between fire hazard characteristics, incident response, and societal impacts/threats incrementally across all phases of active response."
